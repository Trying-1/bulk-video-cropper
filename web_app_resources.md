## Implementation Strategy

To minimize initial costs while building toward your vision, consider this phased approach:

1. **Start with an MVP**
   - Begin with a simplified version focusing on core cropping functionality
   - Use serverless architecture to reduce initial infrastructure costs
   - Implement the free tier first to build user base

2. **Validate with Real Users**
   - Launch a beta program with limited users
   - Collect feedback through direct interviews and usage analytics
   - Iterate based on user behavior and requests

3. **Gradual Feature Expansion**
   - Add premium features incrementally
   - Introduce subscription tiers as you add value
   - Scale infrastructure as user base grows

4. **Build vs. Buy Decisions**
   - Use existing services for non-core functionality (authentication, payments)
   - Focus development resources on your unique value proposition (video cropping)
   - Consider open-source components to accelerate development

This approach allows you to test the market with minimal investment while building toward your complete vision. The most crucial initial investment will be in the core video processing functionality and a smooth, intuitive user interface.
